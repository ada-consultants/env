# ADA Consultants environment initialization

This repository is used to store the script that allows a developper to install
all development dependencies required to work on a project at ADA Consultants
Inc.

This script was only tested on Ubuntu 12.04 (and should only work on it anyway).

## How to install

Run that command in your terminal:

    sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/ada-consultants/env/master/init)"
